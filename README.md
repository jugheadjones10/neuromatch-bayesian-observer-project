In the [Neuromatch Computational Neuroscience course](https://neuromatch.io/computational-neuroscience-course/), we were required to work on a project over a period of 3 weeks in a group.

My group focussed on [this](https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0896-6273%2817%2931134-0) paper: "A Switching Observer for Human Perceptual
Estimation". We investigated Basic Bayesian models of predicting subject responses to motion stimulus.

First we replicated the Basic Bayesian model explained in the paper, and then tried creating a modified "online" model that we felt better modelled human behavior.

Code for all models and analysis are in simple_bayes.ipynb.

The project template we followed is [here](https://compneuro.neuromatch.io/projects/docs/project_templates.html#probing-the-dynamics-of-human-estimation-errors-in-a-bayesian-framework).
